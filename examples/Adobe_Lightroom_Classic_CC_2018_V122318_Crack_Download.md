## Content-Aware Remove

One of the most impressive features in this update is the Content-Aware Remove, which lets you erase anything in seconds. Just select an object or blemish and Lightroom Classic will automatically sample nearby areas of your image to blend it away. This is useful for removing unwanted elements, such as power lines, people, or trash cans, from your photos.

## Adaptive Presets

Another new feature is the Adaptive Presets, which allow you to apply presets to specific parts of your photo in just a click. You can use them to create more dramatic skies, make your subjects stand out, or enhance certain colors. You can also customize the intensity and range of the presets to suit your preferences.

## Book Module Enhancements

If you like to create photo books with Lightroom Classic, you will appreciate the enhancements in the Book module. You can now choose from two new book types (Blurb Magazine and Blurb Trade Book) and a new paper type (Standard Layflat) for more options and quality. You can also choose where page numbers are printed on a book, including on only left or right pages, or all pages. Additionally, you can add your own custom-sized cells within a page that are not restricted by the standard padding.

## Support for New Cameras and Lenses

As always, Lightroom Classic supports new cameras and lenses with each update. In this version, you can find support for cameras such as Canon EOS R5 Mark II, Nikon Z9, Sony Alpha 1, and lenses such as Sigma 24-70mm F2.8 DG DN Art, Tamron 17-70mm F/2.8 Di III-A VC RXD, and more.

## Bug Fixes

Finally, this update also fixes some bugs that were reported by users, such as Lightroom Classic failing to open properly (large metrics.json file), catalog opening in 12.1 but not in 12.2, memory leak when syncing files with the cloud (Mac), and more.
