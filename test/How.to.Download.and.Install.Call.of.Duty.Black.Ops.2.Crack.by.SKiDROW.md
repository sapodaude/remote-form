4. Copy the contents of the folder called SKIDROW to the main installation folder of your game. Overwrite any existing files.
5. Block the game in your firewall and mark the cracked content as secure/trusted in your antivirus program. This will prevent the game from connecting to online servers and being detected as pirated.
